# new-responsive-web-design-certification-color-markers

Reviewing fundamentals of HTML and CSS via the freeCodeCamp - (New) Responsive Web Design Certification, practicing how to build webpages using HTML for content, and CSS for design.

Selecting the correct colors for your webpage can greatly improve the aesthetic appeal to your readers.

In this course, I built a set of colored markers, and learnt the different ways to set color values and how to pair colors with each other.
